# FreeRTOS on STM32F407 Discovery Kit

##FreeRTOS

A **Real-Time Operating System(RTOS)**  is a software that is specifically designed to run applications with very **precise timing** and a high degree of **reliability**. Almost all real-time operating systems provide threading, the illusion that processors can execute many tasks at the same time. Real-time software is ideal for deadline-specific systems. It ensures that the prediction of tasks execution durations is done accurately.

The **[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/)** is a real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices that has been ported to 35 microcontroller platforms. FreeRTOS is designed to be small and simple. The kernel itself consists of only three C files. To make the code readable, easy to port, and maintainable, it is written mostly in C, but there are a few assembly functions included where needed (mostly in architecture-specific scheduler routines).
